                    Once we have agreed an offer in principal, our valuation team will carry out research into the local property market and use this information to confirm your offer. If you are happy with the offer, we will move forward by arranging an official RICS* Surveyor to visit your home (*Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors).<br>
                    <br>The surveyor will give you an official valuation of your property and we will revise our cash offer accordingly. The majority of the time our in-house valuations are accurate and the initial valuation does not need to be revised, as long as you be upfront about the property condition :)<br>
                    <br>Our process is simple, you fill in your details, tell us about the property online, our team does our online due diligence, via reliable data sources, and we make you a proper offer within 48 hours. <br>
                    <br>Here at properoffer, we make the selling process easy, and of course, we do things properly from start to finish.<br>

                        Important: Whilst we make every effort to complete in a reasonable and quick timescale,
                         there are sometimes circumstances that might affect the actual completion date,
                          and in extreme circumstances our ability to purchase.
                           Our initial offer is provisional and will only be confirmed once we are in receipt of a survey,
                            and the searches and contracts are deemed satisfactory by our legal team.
                             Other factors may affect our decision to purchase, or affect the price we eventually agree.
                              Prior to a legal exchange of contracts we can rescind the agreement at any time if we have any knowledge or we are advised that the property is not as initially described and/or anything comes to light that may have affected its value.
                               Alternatively, the purchase price may be renegotiated by mutual consent. 
                               In the event we rescind the agreement then all legal aborted costs,
                                disbursements and survey fees in the transaction will be met by us.
                                 We strongly advise not to commit to any expenditure or completion dates until legal exchange has taken place.
